1) [Introduction to ASP.NET Web Forms](http://www.asp.net/web-forms/what-is-web-forms) i contesta les següents preguntes:


######Advantages of a Web Forms-Based Web Application


The Web Forms-based framework offers the following advantages:
* It supports an event model that preserves state over HTTP, which benefits line-of-business Web application development. The Web Forms-based application provides dozens of events that are supported in hundreds of server controls.
* It uses a Page Controller pattern that adds functionality to individual pages. For more information, see Page Controller on the MSDN Web site.
* It uses view state or server-based forms, which can make managing state information easier.
* It works well for small teams of Web developers and designers who want to take advantage of the large number of components available for rapid application development.
* In general, it is less complex for application development, because the components (the Page class, controls, and so on) are tightly integrated and usually require less code than the MVC model.

######Advantages of an MVC-Based Web Application

The ASP.NET MVC framework offers the following advantages:
It makes it easier to manage complexity by dividing an application into the model, the view, and the controller.
It does not use view state or server-based forms. This makes the MVC framework ideal for developers who want full control over the behavior of an application.
It uses a Front Controller pattern that processes Web application requests through a single controller. This enables you to design an application that supports a rich routing infrastructure. For more information, see Front Controller on the MSDN Web site.
It provides better support for test-driven development (TDD).
It works well for Web applications that are supported by large teams of developers and Web designers who need a high degree of control over the application behavior.


2) [Getting Started with ASP.NET Web API 2 (C#)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api)

HTTP is not just for serving up web pages. It is also a powerful platform for building APIs that expose services and data. HTTP is simple, flexible, and ubiquitous. Almost any platform that you can think of has an HTTP library, so HTTP services can reach a broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and traditional desktop applications.3
ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building web APIs on top of the .NET Framework. In this tutorial, you will use ASP.NET Web API to create a web API that returns a list of products.

3) [Introduction to Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin)

ASP.NET Core supports the Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN). OWIN allows web apps to be decoupled from web servers. It defines a standard way for middleware to be used in a pipeline to handle requests and associated responses. ASP.NET Core applications and middleware can interoperate with OWIN-based applications, servers, and middleware.

4) [Choose between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/choose-aspnet-framework)

**ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web applications on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

**ASP.NET**

ASP.NET is a mature framework that provides all the services needed to build enterprise-class, server-based web applications on Windows.
