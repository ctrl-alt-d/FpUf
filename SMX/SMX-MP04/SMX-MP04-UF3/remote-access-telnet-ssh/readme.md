# Remote access: Telnet & SSH
## SMX-MP04-UF3 - Exercici de compartici√≥ de recursos i seguretat. 
**The aim of this activity is to learn to use Telnet to remotely access to another computer. So, you'll need two machines (the local and the remote one); otherwise, if you don't have it, you can install the both the client and the server in the same machine.
** 

(1) Download and install the Telnet client (telnet) in the Linux computer that will act as client and the Telnet server (telnetd) on the one that will act as server.

(2) Afterwards, install the daemon xinetd that will allow the enabling and disabling of the network services.

(3) Once you've installed all the sofware packages, reboot the network services.

(4) Remotely access from the client to the server and make a list of the contents of the connection folder.
 

**The aim of this part of the activity is to learn to use SSH both to remotely access to another computers and to transfer files. SSH allows to safe access to remote resources either in the machine system or any of its resources.**

(1) Download and install the SSH client (ssh) in the Linux computer that will act as client and the Telnet server (openssh-server) on the server one.

(2) Once you've installed all the sofware packages, access to the server. Which question appears the first time you try to connect?

(3) Choose a file from the local machine and copy it to the remote one.

(4) Change the SSH port (by default, it's 22) to 2022.

(5) Remotely execute a program, for example, firefox.

(6) Create an SSH Tunneling between the client and the server.
